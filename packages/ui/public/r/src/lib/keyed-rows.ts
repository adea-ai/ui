/**
 * Maps a reactive list to stable, key-indexed rows.
 *
 * Server-backed lists — query results, and projections over them — produce fresh
 * object identities on every fetch. Feeding them straight into `<For>` remounts
 * every row on each refetch: open menus close, focus and hover state drop, and
 * the whole subtree's DOM is rebuilt. On a list that refetches on a poll or a
 * websocket tick, that is a visible flicker and a measurable cost.
 *
 * Keying on a stable id keeps each row's DOM alive across refetches and pushes
 * the update through that row's own accessor, so only the bindings whose values
 * actually changed touch the DOM. Removed keys drop their rows; reordered keys
 * keep their rows and move the DOM nodes. Keys must be unique within the list —
 * a duplicate reuses the first entry's row.
 *
 * `equals` decides whether a fresh item replaces the row's stored value. The
 * default treats every new object as a change, which is correct for a projection
 * whose fields are all rendered. Pass a field-level comparator — a version
 * stamp, a revision number — to skip redundant downstream updates entirely.
 *
 * ```tsx
 * const rows = keyedRows(() => tasks(), (task) => task.id, (a, b) => a.version === b.version)
 * return <For each={rows()}>{(row) => <TaskCard task={row.item} />}</For>
 * ```
